# What is this?

This is the final project for the Robotics,Language and Plannig (RLP) class of Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.

Our project consists of a delta robot mounted on a rail and equipped with a Gripper and a Camera sensor. Utilizing these, the robot is capable of detecting and sorting LEGO bricks, recognizing 3D shapes, and recreating said shapes out of the LEGO bricks it sorts.



# Requirements
For the simulation:
- CoppeliaSim

For running the code:
- Python 3.9.x
- numpy
